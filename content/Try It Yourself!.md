# Try It Yourself!

Here are some other interesting quantum phenomenea, try to draw the Feynman Diagram for each one of them!

## Pair production

Did you know that particles can pop out of nowhere? Sometimes, the energy from photons can be converted to the formation of an electron and an positron, and this is known as pair production.

The equation of the interaction is:
$$
\gamma \to e^- + e^+
$$
The $\gamma$ refers to photon, and it uses it's energy to form an electron ($e^-$) and a positron ($e^+$).

Remember the electron-positron annihilation from earlier? This process is the reverse of that.

## Compton Scattering

Compton scattering is the scattering of a photon by an electron. In other words, when a photon ‘hits’ a electron, they undergo inelastic collision, and the photon transfers some momentum and energy to the electron. (sounds familiar? You have seen something similar earlier!)

Actually, there's no change in particles in this interaction! We start with an electron and a photon, and we end with an electron and a photon as well.

## Beta-Plus Decay

We've seen Beta-Decay, but there's also another form of Beta Decay! In this version, a proton converts to a neutron, a positron and a neutrino. As the proton is _uud_ while the neutron is _udd_, the actual interaction only involves an up quark changing to a down quark. The equation is given as:
$$
u \to d + e^+ + v
$$
where $v$ represents the neutrino ejected.

Recall the Beta-Minus decay, and see if you can adapt it to this situation
