Hello there! Are you curious to find out what the bunch of squiggly lines on almost every website explaining quantum physics mean? Fear not, for this site aims to guide you gently through this concept without unnecessarily complicated math! Feel free to browse around; the pages can be read in any order. However, if you are lost, do try reading through them in the order they are presented as we feel that it will seem more logical to you :)
